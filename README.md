# oled_smartwatch
DIY Smartwatch with an ATMega328, DS3231 RTC and a 128x128 oled screen. The initial prototype is made on an perfboard with an Arduino Nano and some thrown together code.
It uses [U8glib2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) for the screen and [RTClib](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) as a library for the RTC.
